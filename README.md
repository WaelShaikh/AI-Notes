# AI Notes - An AI Powered Note-Taking App

AI Notes is an innovative note-taking application that leverages the power of artificial intelligence to enhance your note-taking experience. With AI Notes, you can effortlessly upload your notes using various methods such as typing, copy-pasting, or even utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images, including photos of textbooks, screenshots of PDFs, websites, and more.

## Features

- **Multiple Input Methods**: AI Notes provides multiple ways to input your notes, making it convenient for all types of users.

- **OCR Integration**: Easily extract text from images, saving you time and effort when digitizing content.

- **NLP Question Answering**: Interact with a state-of-the-art NLP Question Answering AI (BERT QnA) to gain valuable insights from your notes. Simply ask questions in natural language, and the AI will analyze your notes, providing answers and insights in response.

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration**: Not only can you see the answers in the editor, but AI Notes can also speak them aloud using a Text-to-Speech Engine.

Once the user has uploaded their notes to the editor, they can then get answers and insights from the notes by querying the NLP Question Answering AI (BERT QnA) via the chat button (This button will only load after the BERT model has loaded and may take some time to appear. This process will be faster on subsequent revisits). The user simply has to provide a question in natural language and the AI will infer and understand the given data via NLP and provide an answer to the userâ€™s query by outputting it to the editor as well as by speaking it out loud using a TTS (Text to Speech) Engine.
