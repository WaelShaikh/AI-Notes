An AI powered note-taking app.

AI Notes allows user to upload their notes via typing, copy-pasting or via OCR, which can extract 
text from photos of textbooks, screenshots of pdf/websites, etc.

Once the user has uploaded their notes to the editor, they can then get answers and insights from the notes 
by querying the NLP Question Answering AI (BERT QnA) via the chat button (This button will only load after the BERT model has loaded and may take some time to appear). The user simply has to provide a question in natural 
language and the AI will infer and understand the given data via NLP and provide an answer to the userâ€™s 
query by outputting it to the editor as well as by speaking it out loud using a TTS (Text to Speech) Engine.
